### Hi there 👋

## Who am I ? 🥸

I'm a French full stack developer currently working at [rayon](https://www.rayon.design) as a _Lead Software Engineer_ and focused on front-end & product.

## What do I like ? ❤️

I love the javascript/typescript ecosystem, especially React & Graphql. 
I believe in scalable projects and enjoy trying new stuffs.


## I work daily with theses 👨‍💻

I'm focused on front-end development with [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/) & [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
and manage data with [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) calls. 
I now use a lot of [tanstack](https://tanstack.com/) libraries and manage the backend using hexagonal archetecture.
